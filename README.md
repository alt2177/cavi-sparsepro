**Abstract:** A common problem in modern machine learning and Bayesian statistics is creating probabilistic models that successfully explain how observed data is generated from intermediary, hidden variables. One method for doing so is variational inference, specifically the Coordinate Ascent Variational Inference (CAVI) algorithm. This method has many applications, one of which is the Fine-Mapping Problem in computational genomics, and the SparsePro model is a novel method to conduct this type of fine mapping. Here, we derive the optimal update step for the CAVI algorithm applied to the SparsePro model.
